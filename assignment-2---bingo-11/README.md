# Project 2 - Secure Game

## Description

This is an implementation of a robust protocol for handling a distributed game of Bingo.
There is a server (playing area) and multiple clients (caller and players) that communicate
with each other using sockets from **Python3.8**. The protocol implements a set of security
features to ensure the integrity of the game.

Developed within the scope of the second group project of Security of Information
and Organizations (2022/2023).
